# SIR-Model-v3-Heterogeneous-Cells
A model that shows the influence of mask compliance on viral spread within a "city" (cellular automaton) of heterogeneous cells. The user is able to specify the percentage of cells that are MaskedCell objects. All remaining cells are regular (maskless) SIRCell objects.
